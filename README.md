Step 1: Run the citibike_demo_gradientboosting.py file to get a quick predictive model. 
The weather data and cike sharing data have already been sorted for this from following locations:
http://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data and http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/qclcd/QCLCD

Step 2: For running other files, the appropriate bike share data files will have to be accessed from 
http://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data and saved in the data folder.
